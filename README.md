# WolfRPG.Core
WolfRPG.Core handles basic data storage and editing. It is intended as a base for the other WolfRPG libraries to build upon, but can be used by itself.

# State of development
WolfRPG.Core is currently usable, but is still under active development and minor breaking changes are likely to occur
